            <br>As the last project for CoderClass, I've worked with a partner to try to create a somewhat functional physics engine.
            <br>The whole idea was to create a simple game, with all the physics code written by us.
            <br>It was made with C++, OpenGL, GLFW, and some other supporting libraries.
            <br>The project was way out of our skills, so we haven't been able to finish it.
            <br>The things that we have implemented are: simple AABB collision detection and resolution,
            <br>(the AABB boxes are visible in the video),
            <br>3d model loading and animating, and simple shooting physics.

                <br>Following the <a href="https://eater.net/8bit">Ben Eater's tutorial</a>, I tried to recreate his 8-bit computer.
                <br>I never got it fully done, but I have made about half of the whole thing.
                <br>I have made the clock module, the three registers, the ALU, and partially the bus.
                <br>In this state the "computer" can add and subtract simple numbers.

                <br>This is the first (somwhat serious) game I've ever made.
                <br>I made it using Python and Pygame.
                <br>Through making this game I've learned Pygame.
